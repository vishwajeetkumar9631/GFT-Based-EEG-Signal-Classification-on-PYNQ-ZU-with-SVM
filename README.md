# GFT-Based-EEG-Signal-Classification-on-PYNQ-ZU-with-SVM
This project implements a Graph Fourier Transform (GFT)-based feature extraction pipeline for EEG signal classification using the ASU imagined speech dataset. The complete processing pipeline has been deployed and tested on a PYNQ-ZU FPGA board, achieving a classification accuracy of 87.23% using an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier.
